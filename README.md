## ABSTRACT

The urban mobility sector is undergoing a major transformation, driven by the integration of advanced technologies. This thesis, entitled **"Design and Implementation of a Smart Traffic Lights System using Microservices and Container-based Virtualization"**, examines how modern technologies can enhance the efficiency, adaptability, and sustainability of traffic management systems in smart cities.

The research focuses on the use of **microservices architecture** and **container-based virtualization** for the development of a complete smart traffic light system, which is implemented in a simulated environment, studying the case of **Campus 1 of the University of West Attica (UNIWA)**. Microservices architecture allows for the development of independently deployable and manageable services, offering flexibility, resilience, and ease of scaling in the application. Container-based virtualization, through technologies such as **Docker** and **Kubernetes**, ensures a consistent and lightweight execution environment across distributed infrastructures, from field devices to the cloud.

The thesis analyses in depth the basic principles of microservices and virtualization, presenting their advantages and technical challenges. Furthermore, it includes a review of relevant literature and existing solutions in the field of intelligent traffic management, highlighting current trends and technologies, with a focus on **data collection and processing through IoT and virtual sensors**.

Case studies present practical applications of the system, such as dynamic adjustment of traffic light cycles based on real-time traffic, decongestion of critical roadways, and route optimization through data analysis. These cases highlight how the coupling of microservices and containers can support the development of intelligent, resilient, and scalable solutions for the future of smart cities.

Through systematic analysis and implementation, this work offers practical insights and a roadmap for leveraging modern technologies in the design and implementation of smart traffic management systems, contributing to the transformation of cities into more sustainable and efficient living spaces.
