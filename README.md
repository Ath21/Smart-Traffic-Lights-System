## ABSTRACT

Urban mobility is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by the integration of advanced technologies. This thesis, entitled **"Design and Implementation of a Smart Traffic Lights System using Microservices and Container-based Virtualization"**, investigates how modern technologies can enhance the efficiency, adaptability, and sustainability of traffic management systems in smart cities.

The study focuses on the application of **microservices architecture** and **container-based virtualization** to develop a comprehensive smart traffic light system, implemented in a simulated environment, taking **Campus 1 of the University of West Attica (UNIWA)** as a case study. Microservices architecture enables the creation of independently deployable and manageable services, offering flexibility, resilience, and scalability. Container-based virtualization, using technologies such as **Docker** and **Kubernetes**, provides a consistent and lightweight execution environment across distributed infrastructures, from field devices to cloud platforms.

The thesis examines the fundamental principles of microservices and containerization, discussing their advantages and technical challenges. It also reviews relevant literature and current solutions in intelligent traffic management, emphasizing trends and technologies for **data collection and processing through IoT and virtual sensors**.

Case studies demonstrate practical applications of the system, including dynamic traffic light cycle adjustments based on real-time traffic, congestion management on critical roads, and route optimization through data analysis. These examples highlight how the combination of microservices and container-based deployment can support the development of intelligent, resilient, and scalable solutions for future smart cities.

Through systematic analysis and implementation, this work provides practical insights and a roadmap for leveraging modern technologies in the design and deployment of smart traffic management systems, contributing to the transformation of urban environments into more efficient and sustainable living spaces.
