# ðŸš¦ Smart Traffic Lights System

## Overview

The **Smart Traffic Light System (STLS)** is a microservices-based platform designed to optimize urban traffic flow, prioritize emergency vehicles, manage public transport, and improve safety for pedestrians and cyclists. It uses **RabbitMQ** for asynchronous messaging and event-driven communication, **MS SQL** and **InfluxDB** for persistent and time-series data storage, respectively, and **Redis** for caching and fast data retrieval. The system leverages containerized services to ensure scalability, fault tolerance, and easy deployment.

---

## Layers & Services

### **1. Sensor Layer**
Simulates and collects traffic-related data from:
- Vehicles
- Emergency Vehicles
- Public Transport
- Pedestrians
- Cyclists
- Incident Reports

---

### **2. Traffic Layer**
- **Intersection Controller Service** â€“ Processes incoming sensor data to decide priorities.
- **Traffic Light Control Service** â€“ Updates lights according to instructions.
- **Traffic Light Coordination Service** â€“ Synchronizes lights across intersections.
- **Traffic Data Analytics Service** â€“ Detects congestion patterns and generates alerts.

---

### **3. User Layer**
- **Notification Service** â€“ Sends alerts to operators and the public.
- **User Service** â€“ Manages operator accounts, roles, and preferences.

---

### **4. Log Layer**
- **Log Service** â€“ Centralized logging from all services for auditing and debugging.

## AMQP Overview and Data Flow Summary

### AMQP Overview

The Smart Traffic Lights System uses RabbitMQ as its messaging backbone to enable asynchronous communication between distributed services. Each service publishes and subscribes to specific AMQP topics (exchanges and queues) identified by structured routing keys, often including intersection IDs for scoped data.

- **Sensor Layer Services** publish real-time traffic and event data (e.g., vehicle counts, emergency vehicle detections, pedestrian crossing requests) on topics prefixed with `sensor.data.*`.
- **Traffic Layer Services** subscribe to sensor data topics to analyze traffic conditions and set priorities. They publish control commands and updates on topics such as `priority.*` and `traffic.light.*`.
- **User Layer Services** subscribe to analytics and notification topics to send alerts to operators and users.
- **Log Layer** centralizes all audit and error logs from every service using wildcard topics like `*.logs.*`, enabling centralized storage and monitoring.

The topic structure ensures decoupled communication where publishers and subscribers do not require direct knowledge of each other, allowing scalability and flexibility in the system.

---

### Data Flow Summary

#### 1. Sensor Layer: Data Collection and Publishing
- Vehicle Detection, Emergency Vehicle Detection, Public Transport Detection, Pedestrian and Cyclist Detection, and Incident Detection services collect real-time data using sensors.
- Each service publishes processed event data to intersection-specific AMQP topics such as:
  - `sensor.data.vehicle.count.<intersection_id>`
  - `sensor.data.emergency_vehicle.<intersection_id>`
  - `sensor.data.pedestrian.request.<intersection_id>`
- These messages represent the raw or pre-processed traffic events captured at each intersection.

#### 2. Traffic Layer: Data Aggregation and Control
- The Intersection Controller Service subscribes to sensor data topics for its intersection.
- It analyzes the incoming data to set priorities (e.g., emergency vehicles, public transport, pedestrians, cyclists) and publishes priority commands on topics like:
  - `priority.emergency.vehicle.<intersection_id>`
  - `priority.pedestrian.<intersection_id>`
- Traffic Light Control Service listens for control commands (`traffic.light.control.<intersection_id>`) and updates the state of individual traffic lights.
- Traffic Light Coordination Service synchronizes light timings across intersections by listening to priority topics and publishing coordinated light updates.
- Traffic Data Analytics Service performs data analytics by subscribing to sensor data topics, detecting congestion or incidents, and publishing alerts on topics such as:
  - `traffic.analytics.congestion.alert`
  - `traffic.analytics.daily.summary`

#### 3. User Layer: Notifications and Interaction
- Notification Service subscribes to analytics alerts and user notification requests, distributing messages to operators or the public via:
  - `notification.event.public_notice`
  - `notification.event.operator_alert`
- User Service manages user accounts and triggers notifications by publishing to `user.notification.request`.

#### 4. Log Layer: Centralized Logging
- All services publish audit and error logs to dedicated topics (e.g., `sensor.logs.audit`, `traffic.logs.error`).
- Log Service subscribes to all logs using wildcard topics like `*.logs.*` for centralized collection and storage.

---

This AMQP topic-driven design enables modular, scalable, and reliable communication between all layers of the traffic management system.

## Use Cases

### A. Traffic Management (Automatic)

1. **Adjust traffic lights based on vehicle flow**  
   - Sensor Layer detects vehicle count and sends it to Intersection Controller.  
   - Controller sets light durations accordingly.  

2. **Prioritize emergency vehicles**  
   - Emergency Vehicle Detection triggers priority mode at intersection.  

3. **Prioritize public transport**  
   - Bus/tram detection extends green light for transit lanes.  

4. **Handle pedestrian and cyclist crossings**  
   - When detected, the light cycle adjusts to allow safe passage.  

5. **Incident response**  
   - Accident or hazard detection changes light cycles to reroute traffic.  

---

### B. Analytics & Monitoring

6. **Real-time traffic status monitoring**  
   - Traffic Light Control & Coordination services expose current light state.  

7. **Congestion alerts**  
   - Analytics service sends alert if congestion threshold is exceeded.  

8. **Daily traffic summaries**  
   - Analytics generates daily/weekly reports for operators.  

---

### C. User Interaction

9. **Operator manual override**  
   - Authorized operators can manually set light states or timing.  

10. **Public notifications**  
    - Push alerts for delays, road closures, incidents.  

11. **User management**  
    - Create, update, and authenticate operator accounts.  

---

### D. System Management

12. **Logging and auditing**  
    - All actions/events stored in centralized log.  

13. **Service health checks**  
    - Endpoints to monitor microservice status.
